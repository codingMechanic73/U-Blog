 *  (Note: 2. You can set the timestamp attribute of the newly created PostDTO object using
 *  LocalDateTime.now(). This method will fetch you the current date and time. Later in the
 *  session, you will learn in detail the use of this method.)
 * TODO 4.22. Print the PostDTO object's data on the console.
 * TODO 4.23. You should also redirect the user to the "View.jsp" page and pass the PostDTO
 *  object along with the request. View page will be created later in the project and
 *  display the blog posted by the user.
